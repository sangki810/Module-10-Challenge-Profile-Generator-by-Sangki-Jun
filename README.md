# Module 10 Challenge:Team Profile Generator by Sangki Jun

## Description
This is the completed module 10 challenge from the UCF FSF Bootcamp. The purpose of this assigment was for the creator to practice using jest for the first time to run tests. This repository was based on a starter-code given by the bootcamp and completed with specific instructions from the program. The code in this repository runs prompts in the terminal to help in creating a team profile HTML file using a base template.
